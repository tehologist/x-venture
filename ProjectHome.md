I have been doing a lot of research in other muds lately, namely dgd, lambdamoo, and naked mud. There are a few insights I have gleamed from these projects. Lambda moo and DGD are so bare bones that in reality they basically are just a loose server, with some functions that help to maintain database and parse input. This gives an unbelievable amount of flexibility with very little code. The kernel lib for dgd handles most of the issues concerning safe object reloading as well as object ownership, and quotas. Lambda Moo most of these things with the exception of parsing are implemented in the individual cores. In essence first priority at this point has been shifted to create a very basic server can be logged into and save eval execute code in a database with no permissions, will see how this experiment goes. Currently also, been working lots with bare python, so going to try to avoid any external dependencies whatsoever. Though Mantissa is looking very nice.
